- Current idea is to store all the data required of the node inside a Data Object that gets serialised and passed into data field of znode - is this correct?

- What goes in the hashmap? Where and when do I set this? 

- Where does that hashing happen? 

- Where do the get / put operations go? 

- How do I make API's for each znode? and how does this interface with a client?
