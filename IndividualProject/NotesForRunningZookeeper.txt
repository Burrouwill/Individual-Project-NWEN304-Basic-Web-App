Starting Zookeeper:

- .\zkServer in powershell within zookeeper directory 
- (Optional) Can start a zookeeper client using: .\zkCli in powershell (The application however will be run in place of this? )


Neeed to actually stop the instances of Application - Just closing the window means they will still run in the background and contribute to Leader Count.

ToDo:

- Leaders list of worker nodes needs to update / be called everytime the status changes 
- Some other stuff to print like port and a list of ports of workers --> The api for client to connect to I think 

- Ids not resetting even inbetween instances?
